Terms used in Inheritance

Class: A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.

Sub Class/Child Class: Subclass is a class which inherits the other class. It is also called a derived class, extended class, or child class.

Super Class/Parent Class: Superclass is the class from where a subclass inherits the features. It is also called a base class or a parent class.

Reusability: As the name specifies, reusability is a mechanism which facilitates you to reuse the fields and methods of the existing class when you create a new class. You can use the same fields and methods already defined in the previous class.

Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.

Single level, Multi level and heritance.

Multiple inheritance is not possible in java - we use interface as alternative

HAS-A relationship

Association is the relation between two separate classes which establishes through their Objects.

Composition and Aggregation are the two forms of association. In Java,

a Has-A relationship is otherwise called composition. It is additionally utilized for code reusability in Java. In Java, a Has-A relationship essentially implies that an example of one class has a reference to an occasion of another class or another occurrence of a similar class.
